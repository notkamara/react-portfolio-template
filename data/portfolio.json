Along side these features, many others such as the number of frames a vehicle has been present for in a video were used in a random forest parked car classifier;The outputs of these models were used to inform insurance claims, forward collision warning and fleet management"

Replaced the network architecture with ResNet50 and resulted in a 2% decrease in latency on average and 13% increase in accuracy."
